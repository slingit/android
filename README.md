#Sling for Android
It's the code for Sling for Android: it does what it says on the tin, really. **This is nowhere near complete: see *Why can I see this?* for more information on that.**

## Getting started
1. Clone the repo  
2. Open Android Studio -> Import Project  
3. Click `sling-android/settings.gradle`  
4. Let Gradle do it's thing.

## What is this?  
Sling is the simplest way to share files from any device. Use our one time frictionless setup and you're good to go!

## Why doesn't this work?  
Sling for Android is still very much in development: so much so that pretty much only the initial setup UI (and some of the logic) is up and running. You'll be able to see new additions as they appear!

## Why can I see this? You guys have private repos, right?  
We do. We fancied a bit of a change. There's really no reason for all of this to be closed source: we want people using the tech behind Sling, dammit!

## Aren't you planning to sell this?  
Yes, we are. However, you're free to run sling-server on your own server, and compile your own version of the Android app without our payment logic and specify your own API endpoint: we just provide an easier way!  

## Hey, where's the other stuff Sling is working on?
Have a look on the GitHub organisation page: [https://github.com/slingit](github.com/slingit)
